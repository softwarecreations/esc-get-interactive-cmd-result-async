# esc-get-interactive-cmd-result-async
async function that runs a shell command with arguments and environment variables, full interactive stdin/stdout/stderr usability (eg: run and use nano). Resolves/rejects with your command's return code.

## Project goals
* No dependencies
* No nonsense
* Reliable, no radical changes will ever happen.
* Small, simple, easy to audit, yourself

If I have ideas for something different, I'll make a new package rather than make breaking changes.
